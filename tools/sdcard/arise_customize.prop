# The ARISE™ modular installation zip works by using this file (when present in /sdcard as /sdcard/arise_customize.prop) to determine if any modules are to be installed by a value of "true" for each line below.


# Any value other than "true" is the same as a value of "false".


# Add a value of "true" to desired add-on(s). Example:



install.xxxx=true



# The core module must be installed at least once. Once the core module is installed, the value of "true" should be removed for future customization installing, uninstalling, or executing scripts and modules.


# If a rom update or system wipe is performed resulting in the need to reinstall the sound system, edit /sdcard/arise_customize.prop to include a value of "true" for the core module to complete your sound system installation, followed by removing the value of "true" from the core module once booted.



install.core=true



# Select either ViPER4Arise™ version below to be installed or ignore to not install ViPER4Arise™ at all.
